SUMO Scenario Generator
=======================

This web application generates and downloads the necessary files to start a basic road traffic simulation in SUMO. 

It's supposed to be implemented on a web server, but it can run locally if SUMO and Python are installed and PHP is enabled to run (you could use WAMP, MAMP or LAMP).
